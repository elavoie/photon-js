<h1>Artifact Description</h1>

<p>This artifact comprises both a source-to-source compiler that enables
dynamic instrumentation of JavaScript programs and a test runner to run the
experiments used to obtain the performance results obtained in the evaluation
section of the paper. Although it is unlikely that the exact configuration we
used could be replicated, hopefully, our results should mostly hold on similar
configurations, even with more recent browser versions.</p>

<h2>Photon Source-to-Source Compiler</h2>

<p>The Photon source-to-source compiler has been packaged inside a linux
virtual machine intended to run on Virtual Box.<br>
<ul>
    <li>VM Username: photon</li>
    <li>VM Password: photon</li>
</ul>

The photon system is in the <code>photon-js-ecoop2014</code> directory.<br>
Alternatively, a copy of the github <a
href="https://github.com/elavoie/photon-js/tree/ecoop2014">repository</a> can
be obtained. The system requires <a
href="http://nodejs.org/download/">NodeJS</a> to run. The <code>photon</code>
executable can be created by invoking <code>make photon</code> inside the
repository once NodeJS has been installed.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>The compiler can be invoked by running <code>photon</code> from the command line.</p>

<h3>Compiling a Simple JavaScript Program to Run on Photon</h3>
<p>A source-to-source translation can be performed by invoking photon on a javascript source file:<br>
ex: <code>photon examples/fib.js</code><br>
<p>

<p>The translated program is outputed by default on the standard output.</p>

<p>The program can be run directly on Photon right after the translation by
adding the <code>--run</code> option when invoking Photon.<br>
ex: <code>photon --run examples/fib.js</code><br>
The output should be 55.</p>

<h3>Providing a Dynamic Instrumentation</h3>

<p>A dynamic instrumentation can be supplied with the option
<code>--use_instrumentation=FILE</code> and its results will be printed if
<code>--show_instrumentation_results</code> is also supplied.<br>
ex: <code>photon --run --use_instrumentation=instrumentations/simple.js --show_instrumentation_results examples/fib.js</code><br>
</p> 

<h3>Recreating the Experiments of the Next Section</h3>

<p>Invoking <code>make html-benchmarks</code> uses Photon to regenerate all the
benchmarks that are used for the experiment section next. They will be found
under <code>benchmarks/html/bench</code> and the benchmark runners under
<code>benchmarks/html</code>.</p>

<h2>Experiments</h2>

<p>To allow independent replication of performance results without having to
perform a source-to-source compilation of the benchmarks, we provide versions
of the benchmarks running both over Photon with different options, and directly
on the JavaScript virtual machine. All of the benchmarks can be found under
the 'bench' directory.</p>

<p>Opening the html page of a single benchmark will run it and output the score
in the developer console of the web browser. In addition, the "benchmark
runner" links run in a single web page and execute all the benchmarks in a
separate iframe. When all the benchmarks have been run, a summary of the
results is written in the page. The number of times a benchmark is run can be
modified by changing the 'nbRepetitions' variable in the runner page source
code. The default is 5.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have no automatic way of measuring and reporting the
memory overhead in a portable way. Our results were obtained by running over
the V8 shell and inspecting the garbage collection traces. To replicate the
results inside a browser, its developer documentation should be consulted.  We
suggest running each of the benchmark in a separate page and finding the
maximum memory usage using the developer tools. In our tests, Photon used
between 1x and 3x of the space used by the original benchmark, except for
EarleyBoyer where it used 6.5x (specifically 128MB instead of 20MB).</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>The results for the JIT versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox were
obtained over vanilla configurations of the latest browser versions at the time
of writing the first version of the paper (March 2013).</p>

<p>Configuration:
<ul>
    <li><b>Safari</b> version 6.0.2 (8536.26.17), based on the Nitro JS VM</li>
    <li><b>Chrome</b> version 25.0.1364.172, based on the V8 JS VM</li>
    <li><b>Firefox</b> version 20.0 based on the SpiderMonkey JS VM</li>
</ul>
on a computer with 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 16 GB 1600 MHz
DDR3 RAM and running OS X 10.8.2.
</p>

<p>The results for the Firefox interpreter version were obtained by setting the
following options to <code>false</code> in <code>about:config</code>:<br>
<ul>
    <li><code>ion.content</code></li>    
    <li><code>methodjit.chrome</code></li>    
    <li><code>methodjit.content</code></li>    
    <li><code>typeinference</code></li>    
</ul>

Note that the name of some of these options have changed in the latest version
of Firefox (at the time of packaging this artifact, March 2014, the latest version of Firefox is 27.0.1).
<code>typeinference</code> now has two sub-options for <code>chrome</code> and
<code>content</code> and <code>methodjit</code> does not exist anymore. Since
the configuration to use is a moving target, we suggest to ask the options for
deactivating the JIT on the <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/jsapi">#jsapi</a>
Mozilla IRC channel.</p>

<p>The signification of the acronyms used when reporting results are the following:<br>
<ul>
    <li><code>[nophoton]</code>: Benchmark running directly over the JavaScript
    virtual machine.</li>
    <li><code>[photon]</code>: Benchmark running over Photon with inline
    caching and no instrumentation.</li>
    <li><code>[photon-simple]</code>: Benchmark running over Photon with inline
    caching and a simple instrumentation that counts the number of property read,
    written, and deleted during execution. This is a straight-forward
    implementation.</li>
    <li><code>[photon-fast]</code>: Benchmark running over Photon with inline
    caching and an instrumentation that counts the number of property read,
    written, and deleted during execution, but has been optimized to work well in
    inline caching.</li>
    <li><code>[photon-noic]</code>: Benchmark running over Photon with no
    inline caching and no instrumentation.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Photon vs No-Photon</h3>

<p>For this experiment, we measure the overhead introduced by Photon compared
to running the benchmarks directly over the JavaScript virtual machine. The
results used for the paper are given <a href="photon-vs-nophoton-paper.html">here</a>.  
The experiments can be run by visiting this 
<a href="photon-vs-nophoton-runner.html">benchmark runner</a>.</p> 

<h3>Photon with a simple instrumentation vs Photon with a fast instrumentation</h3>

<p>For this experiment, we compare the overhead of using Photon with an
instrumentation that would have been quickly developed without care for
performance (<a href="instrumentation/simple.js">simple</a>) against the 
same instrumentation that is optimized for the inline caches 
(<a href="instrumentation/fast.js">fast</a>). The
results used for the paper are given <a href="photon-simple-and-fast-vs-photon-paper.html">here</a>.  
The experiments can be run by visiting this 
<a href="photon-simple-and-fast-vs-photon-runner.html">benchmark runner</a>.</p> 

<h3>Photon vs Photon with no inline caching</h3>
<p>For this experiment, we measure the effectiveness of inline caching to
achieve our performance results, compared to Photon without inline caching. The
results used for the paper are given <a href="photon-noic-vs-photon-paper.html">here</a>.  
The experiments can be run by visiting this 
<a href="photon-noic-vs-photon-runner.html">benchmark runner</a>. 
Note that the EarleyBoyer benchmark is not run because it uses to
much memory.
