In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,\n\
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\n\
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\n\
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes\n\
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;\n\
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows\n\
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.\n\
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,\n\
And the continuance of their parents' rage,\n\
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,\n\
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;\n\
The which if you with patient ears attend,\n\
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.";
